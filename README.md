# Biological-Images-Datasets
Just a online centralized access to biological images dataset to explore in pattern matching and Machine Learning research.

Suggested path (TODO):
- Apply semantic segmentation relying on many levels of deepeness and size of Convolutional Neural Nets layers.
- Apply sequential models for sequence of coarse-grained extracted features.
- Apply Generative Adversarial model with previous model as generator.


Human Arts

Some of the images are paitings by artists made public by themself, until now:

- Collective made art.
- Anny Lemos, Brazil.
- Adobe Behance (pop art and other) https://www.behance.net/.

Biological Photos

- Samples personally made by me.

Biological Paintings

- Charlotte, https://services.math.duke.edu/~rachel/resources/charlotte2012.html (very high resolution).
