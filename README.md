# Biological-Images-Datasets
Just a online centralized access to biological images dataset to explore in pattern matching and Machine Learning research.

Suggested path (TODO):
- Apply semantic segmentation relying on many levels of deepeness and size of ANN layers.
- Apply sequential models for sequence of coarse-grained extracted features.
- Apply Generative Adversarial model with previous model as generator.
