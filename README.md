# Biological-Images-Datasets
Just a online centralized access to biological images dataset. Explore in pattern matching and Machine Learning research. Go talk with the artists and biologists.

Suggested pathway to pattern matching architecture:
- Apply semantic segmentation relying on many levels of deepeness and size of Convolutional Neural Nets layers.
- Apply sequential models for sequence of coarse-grained extracted features.
- Apply Generative Adversarial model with previous model as generator.
