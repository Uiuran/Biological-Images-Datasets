# Biological-Images-Datasets
Just a online centralized access to biological images dataset. Explore in pattern matching and Machine Learning research. Go talk with the artists and biologists.

Suggested pathway to pattern matching architecture:
- Apply semantic segmentation relying on many levels of deepeness and size of Convolutional Neural Nets layers.
- Apply sequential models for sequence of coarse-grained extracted features.
- Apply Generative Adversarial model with previous model as generator.

## Human Arts

Some of the images are paitings by artists made public by themself, until now:

- Collective made art.
- Anny Lemos, Brazil.
- Frei Pedro, Brazil.
- Adobe Behance (pop art and other) https://www.behance.net/.

## Biological Photos/Paintings

- Samples personally made by me (photos).
- Jill Bliss Biologist https://www.jillbliss.com/nature-medleys (photos/painting)
- Charlotte, https://services.math.duke.edu/~rachel/resources/charlotte2012.html (painting) (very high resolution).
